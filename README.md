# UOLTT Desktop Client

The UOLTT Desktop Client is a windows form application designed to be able to view details about ships, systems and trade items within the Star Citizen universe.

At a later date (soon:tm:) the application should also allow players to be able to submit the prices of the items available to sell and what system those prices are at.


Currently written in C# currently, the application pulls data from a JSON GET API
